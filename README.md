## Features

#### Logo

![News Echo Logo](assets/media/readme/newsecho-logo.png)

The logo features a minimalist and modern design that reflects the site’s focus on clarity and accessibility. The design is simple yet striking, ensuring the logo is easily recognisable and ties directly to the site’s name. It consists of two main elements:

1. Bold "N":
  - This represents the title "News Echo".
2.	Radiating Curves:
	- Two curved lines extend outward from the "N", resembling waves or signals. These represent communication, connection, and the spread of knowledge.

This logo captures the site's focus on accessibility and sharing information in a way that is easy for everyone to engage with. 

#### Navigation Menu

The navigation bar is very intutitive and easy to navigate through the different options of HOME - CONTACT US - FAQ.  When viewed on mobile the menu turns into a burger icon and expands to a full menu when enlarged for tablets and desktops. 

#### Hero Section

In the Hero section we can see displayed the choosen title of the app "NEWS ECHO" to enhance it's purpose. Depending of the day, the user is greeted by different messages: "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon" and "Good Evening". The user will be also able to check the current date depending on his timezone.

![Hero Screenshot](assets/media/readme/hero_picture.png)

#### Weather Widget

The weather widget is displayed clearly, using a universal cloud symbol.  Todays current weather is displayed with a large volume speak button, when the user selects this the weather will be spoken out loud to them.  If they click and select anywhere on the weather it will display weather for the next couple of days. It is intuitive and easy to use. It has been designed with users who may have poor motor skills and or visual impairments. 

#### News Widget

The news widget is a large News symbol button with sound waves, when the user clicks on the large speaker button the news will be spoken to them.  They can choose to select to have the News headline title spoken to them first and they choose weather they wish to listen to the full article.  This allows to them to choose between different news articles that they are interested in.

#### Footer

The Footer is devided in two parts. In the first is displayed a "Contact us" button that bring the user to the Team page.
In the second part, the user will be able to access social media pages from an Irish association called "Fighting Blindness" if they need support or information.
The last part is about the Copyright with a link to the Team page.

![Footer Screenshot](assets/media/readme/footer_picture.png)

#### Contact Page
The Contact Page provides a space to showcase the talented individuals behind the project. Rather than being a traditional contact form, this page serves as a “Meet the Team” section, giving visitors insight into the team members’ skills, backgrounds, and professional experiences.
Each team member is presented in a visually appealing format with a professional photo, name, role, and a brief personal introduction. The profiles highlight each member’s background, current expertise, and aspirations.


#### About Us Page
Meet the team who developed the website. Each team members bio, photo, linkedin and github profiles are clearly displayed with links that open in separate pages. 

#### FAQ Page
On our Frequently Asked Questions page, we’ve made it easier for users with poor motor skills or visual impairments to interact with the content. Instead of needing to click on a small arrow, you can click anywhere on the question to open or close the answer section.

The FAQ includes useful links to comprehensive guides from external sources to equip our user with knowledge of support services and accessible technology available.  We give clear instructions on how to change display settings on their apple or android devices.  We provide guidance if they have difficulties with our website, we explain how we handle personal information.  We explain how to use voice commands on the site and how our site is compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies. 

A comprehensive guide to common frequently asked questions that our users may have enabling them to be better informed, independent technically savvy users.

## Agile Workflow for GitHub Project Board

Agile methodology was used throughout the project.  At the beginning of the project, the team conducted a brainstorming session to generate ideas for the site's features. These ideas were captured as user stories and detailed into tasks with MoSCow proioties.  This initaial step was recorded on a google spreadsheet and categorisedto organise tasks efficientl and then transferred over to Project Boards on Github. On issues recorded on the Projects Board were recorded in a medhoical manner, in a step by step detail to ensure all tasks were detailed correctly to manage workflow and assign the correct team member to the task.  

A template was created to help write User Stories and define Epics.

![Issue Template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/118a3d02-e88d-433b-ba2f-0c6eb926a29e)

#### Daily Workflow:
After the details of the project were recorded, each team member was allocated a must have task.  The more experienced members of the team outlined the best methodolgoy for working in a proficant manner within Gitpod and Github and clear instructions on git commands were pinned in the teams slack channel to ensure all team members understood and carried out the same commands to avoid conflicts.

The team leader kept detailed minutes of each sprint and followed up on issues from the previous sprint.  The team leader ensured all members of the team were allocated some time to discuss their particular tasks and any issues they were having and were given the appropriate advice from other team members.  

Each team worked using the project board and ticked off their tasks as they completed them and moved them to the approaite section.  The quality control team member after reviewing the code would create and allocate tasks which were highlighted to the team member as required. 

**Progress Updates**: At the end of each sprint, the board was reviewed:  
   - Items were moved to in progress
   - Completed tasks were moved to **Done**.  
   - Outstanding tasks were re-examined to determine which ones were most urgent for the following sprint.
   - Quality control team member reviewed outstanding bugs and allocated team member to review.

#### Completion:  
This iterative approach ensured that all issues were addressed, resulting in a fully functional website with all planned features successfully implemented.

#### Project Board

* Epics were written containing possible user stories and based on that the website was made.
* User stories were created by looking at epics and through iterations the project was advancing.
* Labels were added to sort the issues based on the importance which resulted to have unclosed issues as labelled as "won't have":
* Closed issues.
* Opened issues.
* The Project Board is set to public.
* The Project Board was used to track progression of the task through the Todo, In progress and Done columns:

![Projects Board](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec533b41-a4de-4ab9-a4e0-a142916a644b)

#### Colours

We described our project goals to ChatGPT and asked for 5 suggestions of a colour scheme for our application. We asked to include a background colour, a primary colour for headings, a secondary text and links, and an accent colour for buttons etc. Except for the background colour, we asked for 2 variations of each colour, leading to 5 colour schemes of 7 colours each:

<table>
 <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th> Basic Color Scheme</th>
  </tr>
 <tr>
        <td><strong>1.</strong>(Classic Contrast)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/basic-1.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>2.</strong> (Subdued Sophistication)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/basic-2.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>3.</strong> (Nature Inspired)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/basic-3.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>4.</strong> (Warm Embrace)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/basic-4.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>5.</strong> (Monochrome Modernity)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/basic-5.png"></th>
  </tr>
</table>

Keeping our user personas in mind, we then wanted to test how these colours would be seen by with different types of visual impairments, namely Colour Vision Deficiency. We created a mockup for our landing page and tested each layout for 8 types of colour blindness using a [Color Blind Vision Simulator](https://pilestone.com/pages/color-blindness-simulator-1?srsltid=AfmBOooS3NaYz6ZSMBzkC52-VBPHp0FpKVg1DJi_okGUmlTMUueONlkM) :

- Green-weak (Deuteranomaly)
- Red-weak (Protanomaly)
- Blue-weak (Tritanomaly)
- Monochromacy (Tritanomaly)
- Red-blind (Protanopy)
- Green-blind (Deuteranopy)
- Blue-blind (Deuteranopy)
- Blue Cone Monochromacy

<table>
 <tr>
        <th>Color Scheme</th>
        <th>Contrast Grid</th>
  </tr>
 <tr>
        <td><strong>1.</strong>(Classic Contrast)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/color-scheme-1.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>2.</strong> (Subdued Sophistication)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/color-scheme-2.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>3.</strong> (Nature Inspired)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/color-scheme-3.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>4.</strong> (Warm Embrace)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/color-scheme-4.png"></th>
  </tr>
   <tr>
        <td><strong>5.</strong> (Monochrome Modernity)</td>
        <th><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/color-scheme-5.png"></th>
  </tr>
</table>

We also used [EightShapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to determine the contrast between each of the 7 shades of each colour scheme.

<table>
<tr>
      <th>Color Contrast Combinations</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td><img style='width:100%'src="assets/media/readme/color-scheme-eight-grid.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

All colour schemes were readable for individuals with various types of visual impairments. Our criteria for choosing a scheme were:

- The colours should be visually inviting across different types of impairments
- The colours need to align with the website's purpose. In the morning, after waking up, warmer tones might be more comfortable for the eyes, as they can help reduce overstimulation.
- The colour combinations should achieve a high AAA rating or better, making them well-suited for our intended application with high colour contrast.

Based on these criteria, we observed:

- Colour Schemes 2, 3 and 5 look a bit strange for certain types of impairments
- Colour scheme 1 has a strong visual contrast and is visually appealing across impairment types. The bright tone could help with waking up.
- Colour schemes 2 and 5 score lower than the other schemes for certain combinations

Our final chosen colour scheme was **Color Scheme 1 (Classic Contrast)**, based on the results and a vote amongst our team members.

#### Typography

 - Based on reseach into font that was readable to people with visual impairments and dyslexia the font type Roboto and sans-serif were chosen as the sites primary font.
   
#### UX Research

To inform our design and layout decisions, we adopted a user-centric approach and sought to create user personas. We outlined our project goals to ChatGPT and asked for assistance in generating five user personas that represent our target audience for the application:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Description</th>

We would like to thank Andrew our Hack Lead whom we always available for support if we needed it.  Thank you to CI for organising a great hackathon, accessibility is such an important and often forgotton aspect for many people living their day to day lives, this opportunity to create this webpage has made us all more informed about coding with accessibility to the forefront of our minds. We would like to also thank any partners, family, friends, children and pets that may have been neglected over the last few days ;)
