        "Wild excitement at the news that the world famous footballer Ronaldinho has been seen at Cop29. In fact it looks as if he may have been there yesterday. Baku TV reported his exciting visit, as he descended from his private jet and shook lots of peoples’ hands. Apparently this is NOT his first visit to Azerbaijan. He has been before, and was in discussions about setting up a private sports academy there. Yes, it’s Cop29 for all your sports news and gossip. Meanwhile further west, members of the European Parliament have voted to postpone a landmark deforestation law this afternoon, even as its negotiators at Cop29 push for stronger action to stop the planet from heating. The shift is set to delay stricter rules on deforestation that could help save trees around the world, giving bis businesses until the end of 2025 and small businesses until July 2026 to comply with the rules. Climate groups reacted with anger to the vote. Global Witness, which estimates the delayed adoption could deforest an area more than fourteen times the size of Paris, said the European Parliament had “taken a chainsaw” to the deforestation law. Greenpeace said the move was “absolutely shameful”. WWF took aim at the European People’s Party, the centre-right grouping that had previously supported the law, for choosing “political posturing over climate action.” The law aims to fight climate breakdown and the death of nature by stopping deforestation related to the EU’s consumption of food and other goods. It covers products such as beef, cocoa, coffee, palm oil and paper. Campaigners also criticised the introduction of a new category of countries posing “no risk” on deforestation, which the Parliament says will face “significantly less stringent” rules. They fear the loophole could result in high-risk countries exporting their products via low-risk countries, bringing products produced through the felling or burning of forests into the hands of consumers in Europe. Anke Schulmeister-Oldenhove, from the European branch of WWF, said: “Today’s decision also undermines voters’ trust in EU policy-making as a whole, and sends a shameful signal on the climate agenda of the new European Parliament during the ongoing climate negotiations in Baku.” The European Parliament said the delay would help operators around the world implement the law smoothly, and without undermining its objectives. Global Witness, Greenpeace and WWF have called on the European Commission to withdraw the proposal altogether. China is going through the longest summer on record, according to China Daily. “As of Wednesday, Guangzhou had broken a three-decade heat record, having experienced 235 summer days as measured by temperature. The city experienced a total of 234 hot days in 1994, it said. Guangzhou, which entered its warm temperature period on March 23, usually starts cooling around Nov 9. Based on current temperatures, the province still does not have autumn conditions, and so summer this year will continue, meteorologists said. Meanwhile typhoons continue to roam through the region. The all-important text on the climate finance goal was described on Thursday as “a workable basis for discussion for the first time in the three years of the technical process,” by Yalchin Rafiyev, Cop29’s lead negotiator and Azerbaijan’s deputy minister of foreign affairs. That is not what many countries think, with some describing it as the opposite, as the Guardian pointed out. The task of producing an acceptable text to take in the second week of Cop29, when the hardball high-level negotiating takes place, is critical to delivering the funding desperately needed by developing nations to cope with the worsening impacts of global heating. Key disagreements are on the total finance number and how much is from public money, loans and private finance. “Of course, there are some diverging views and there are some points that still need to find a convergence zone,” Rafiyev said “With some revisions and some streamlining this text should be a starting point. The text currently on the table is the product of three years of hard work in an inclusive process. There is no alternative to this text and everybody understands that.” Rafiyev was also asked about Argentina’s delegation being withdrawn from Cop29 by its far-right President Javier Milei, who has called climate change a “socialist lie”. He said this was a “bilateral matter” between the UN and Argentina and would not comment further. Rafiyev faced another question about France’s top French climate official Agnès Pannier-Runacher cancelling her attendance at Cop29. This happened after Azerbaijan president Ilham Aliyev accused France of “brutally” suppressing climate change concerns in its Pacific island territories and claiming the “regime of President Macron” had killed citizens protesting legitimately in New Caledonia. France has supported Armenia in its conflict against Azerbaijan, but countries hosting Cops are expected to put aside such bilateral disagreements in order to act as neutral brokers in the negotiations. “We have opened our doors to everybody and our doors are still open,” said the apparently unflappable Rafiyev. A new report from Global Witness has found that 880,000 people in COP29 host Azerbaijan live within 5km of a gas flaring site. This means that more than one in every 12 Azeri is exposed to powerful pollutants from flaring that can lead to serious medical problems, including asthma, premature birth, heart failure, cancer and strokes. In 2023, the WHO attributed more than one in five deaths from heart disease and stroke in Azerbaijan to air pollution. Read the full report here. Many countries are offering treats at their Cop29 pavilions, writes our colleague Dharna Noor: the UK’s has a coffee bar; Georgia’s last night served wine samples. But no pavilion’s offerings can top the Russian Federation’s. There, passerbys can pick up a coloring book produced by the Russian majority state-owned gas company — yes, really. Its cover deems it full of “ecological coloring for children,” and it’s full of tips on how to promote environmental sustainability, including uplifting the “safety and environmental friendiness of fuel stations.” Other pages encourage children to “plant trees and flowers” and or urges them not to “throw away batteries and lightbulbs, recycle them.” Thank you for the advice, dear multinational gas producer. (And a hat tip to climate diplomacy tracker extraordinaire Ed King for the tip!) Gazprom isn’t the only gas company that has advertised to children via coloring books. Here’s a US instance from 2011: https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jul/14/gas-fracking-children-colouring-book Hallo, this is Bibi van der Zee, taking over the liveblog from my esteemed colleague Matthew Taylor for the next few hours at Cop29. Please send your thoughts and suggestions my way, at bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com. Germany’s climate envoy Jennifer Morgan has called China’s climate finance contributions in recent years “an important mini-step.” Repeating calls from rich countries to widen the pool of contributors, Morgan called for a new approach to climate finance. She pointed to a statement from China’s vice-premier, Ding Xuexiang, who told world leaders on Tuesday that China has stumped up RMB 177 billion ($24.5 billion) to support other country’s climate efforts since 2016. The sum works out at about $3 billion per year. “This is an important mini-step,” said Morgan. “But it remains open exactly which flows of money are counted here - and the quality of the financing is at the moment unclear.” She added: “It shows China can do a lot, and is already doing something. But only that which is transparent can be recognised.” Poor countries need $1 trillion a year in climate finance by 2030, five years earlier than rich countries are likely to agree to at UN climate talks. That was the finding of a study published this morning that my colleague Fiona Harvey has broken down for you here. At a previous Cop in 2009, rich countries made and then broke a promise to mobilise a tenth of that amount by 2020, meeting the target for the first year in 2022. They have pushed back against efforts to contribute more money unless rich oil countries in the Middle East and China also chip in. Climate activist groups at Cop29 are linking the war in Gaza to the climate crisis – arguing that western governments and big oil are driving both, with dire consequences for humanity. Asad Rehman, executive director of War on Want which is part of the demand climate justice coalition, told a panel in Baku: “We stand at a crossroads with the very future of humanity at stake, facing a life or death struggle for humanity: on the one side the right of everyone to live with dignity or a world of walls and fences and sacrificed people,” he said. Josh Gabbatiss, from Carbon Brief has published an update on social media about where negotiations at Cop29 have got to. You may have seen talk of new texts about the climate finance negotiations doing the rounds. These proposals have been produced by the co-chairs and circulated among negotiators and civil society observers, but for some reason they are not being published on the UNFCCC website. I’ve explained what’s going on in this thread: https://x.com/Josh_Gabbatiss/status/1856939519347511393 https://bsky.app/profile/joshgabbatiss.bsky.social/post/3lav6l4xtyk2u In short, developing countries unanimously rejected the slimline 9-page text put together by the co-chairs on Tuesday (and many developed countries were not happy about it either). They asked the co-chairs to produce a new text that accounted for everyone’s suggestions. The result, predictably, is a text that ballooned from 9 pages to 34 pages. Last night, there was hope that the co-chairs would be given a mandate by parties to significantly cut this text in order to make it more manageable. Instead, parties asked them to cut some of the flab, but not to add or remove anything substantial. The result is a text that is just one page shorter. Negotiations are currently on-going… If delegates want evidence of the reality of the climate crisis they only need to look at Spain, which has been hit by catastrophic flooding for the second time in two weeks. More than 200 people have been killed and the anger towards politicians for their perceived failure to protect the public should serve as a warning to the leaders negotiating at Cop29. My colleague Jonathan Watts has written a piece today looking at the likely impact of Donald Trump’s victory in the US on the climate crisis. He warns that the ecological crisis created the setting for Trump’s economy-first, doomsday bunker win – and it’s the global south that will suffer most Away from the sterile corridors of Cop29 the BBC has a story which offers a good reminder of the wonder of the natural world. It reports that the world’s biggest coral – larger than a blue whale – has been recorded in the Pacific Ocean. Manu San Felix, a videographer working on a National Geographic ship in the remote parts of the Pacific, said it was like seeing a “cathedral underwater”. “It’s very emotional. I felt this huge respect for something that’s stayed in one place and survived for hundreds of years,” he said. “Make polluters pay” is the banner festooned across the terraces of the huge football stadium that is at the heart of the Cop29 conference on Thursday. Its target is rich nations, whose enormous emissions now and in the past have created the climate crisis. Instead of football chants, the campaigners are calling for the trillions of dollars of climate finance needed by developing countries to curb the devastating impacts they did little to cause. “We are calling to all developed countries to take responsibility,” says Sandra Guzman, from Mexico and at the Climate Finance Group for Latin America and the Caribbean, who is at her 16th Cop. “They have to pay up for their historical responsibilities.” Agreeing a new figure for the annual climate finance, called the “new collective quantified goal” is the key task of Cop29 and negotiations will be fierce between the rich nations with responsibility to pay and the poor ones needing the money. “This NCQG is a matter of survival, because this is the only goal on climate finance that we will get,” said Guzman. She says the money needs to be grants, not loans. Private sector finance might be able to deliver renewable energy projects but she says it cannot provide the infrastructure that is needed to protect communities from heatwaves, floods and storms: “You cannot make profit out of adaptation.” Another problem is that there is no agreed definition of climate finance, meaning that what exactly makes up the existing $100bn a year flow is opaque. Cop29 may or may not agree a definition, but at the very least it has to exclude some projects, she says: “Some countries are saying that gas investments are climate finance, because they have less emissions than coal. But gas is still a fossil fuel.” Away from the Cop negotiations fossil fuel giant Shell was celebrating earlier this week when when it won an appeal against a landmark climate judgment that had ruled it must limit its emissions. But my as my colleague Isabella Kaminski reports the decision does not spell the end of climate litigation against the big companies driving the climate crisis. As negotiators get down to business this morning my colleague Ajit Niranjan has a sobering report which reveals that current policies would lead to a disastrous 2.7C of warming. This would cause a level of disruption that many scientists say will put human civilisation at risk. It adds that the expected level of global heating by the end of the century has not changed since 2021, with “minimal progress” made this year, according to the Climate Action Tracker project. Here is more on the story about how much poorer nations will need in to cope with the escalating impact of the climate crisis, by my colleague Fiona Harvey. She reports that the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, a group of leading economists, say $1tn will be needed by 2030 – five years earlier than previously suggested. The huge challenge now will be getting richer nations to pay up. Day 4 of Cop promises to be quieter, with world leaders flying home after their Tuesday and Wednesday speeches. Events today will focus on climate finance — the key issue for the negotiations. Parties are working to broker a deal ensuring developing countries receive funding to help cope with climate disasters and phase out fossil fuels. It’s urgent, since a 2009 agreement to contribute $100 billion annually — which was only fulfilled in 2022 — expires this year. How much money negotiators should commit depends on who you ask. The need could easily top $2tn each year; developing countries are asking for a minimum of $1.3tn. The talks have zeroed in on a goal of at least $1 trillion a year — about 1% of the global economy — by 2035. That figure comes from a 2022 paper from the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG), a group of leading economists that has advised UN climate negotiations since 2021. The IHLEG will release an update to that report later this morning. Stay tuned, as my colleague Fiona Harvey will have the scoop. Finance negotiations in Cop29 are fraught, and tensions are generally high. France’s ecology minister yesterday canceled her flight to Baku after Azerbaijan’s president railed against France for its colonial “crimes” in its overseas territories. Argentina’s president Javier Milei ordered his team home from the negotiations. And concerns about Donald Trump’s pledge to exit the Paris climate agreement are rampant. Yesterday, Barbados prime minister Mia Mottley — a climate justice champion and a bit of a UN climate talks celebrity — invited Donald Trump to a face-to-face meeting to seek “common ground” on the climate crisis. “Let us find a common purpose in saving the planet and saving livelihoods,” she told my colleague Fiona Harvey. “We are human beings and we have the capacity to meet face-to-face, in spite of our differences. We want humanity to survive.” Good morning, this is Matthew Taylor, your online guide to Cop29 for today, the fourth day of the climate summit.

        "When Donald Trump tapped a Fox News host this week to run the mighty US defense department, even Pete Hegseth’s colleagues at the rightwing media outlet were taken aback. “What the heck – can you believe it?” wondered Jesse Watters on his primetime show on Tuesday. “Taken right from this very couch!” exclaimed Hegseth’s fellow Fox &amp; Friends talker Brian Kilmeade on Wednesday. This bemused enthusiasm was for public, on-air consumption. But in private, some had a dimmer view, according to Brian Stelter, author of two books about the Murdoch-controlled network. “You’re telling me Pete is going to oversee 2 million employees?” clucked one Fox host to Stelter; as the CNN media analyst noted, it’s actually almost three. In Hoax: Donald Trump, Fox News, and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth, Stelter reported that Hegseth – a decorated veteran who served with the Minnesota national guard in Iraq and Afghanistan – consistently played to a singularly important viewer, checking his phone during commercial breaks in case Trump had commented on the show. And while Hegseth has directed a non-profit veterans’ advocacy group, nothing suggests he’s ready to run the world’s largest military. More alarmingly, he has encouraged Trump to pardon military personnel accused of war crimes, argued against women serving in the armed forces, and expressed the merit in a “preemptive strike” against North Korea. Although extreme, this development isn’t exactly breaking new ground. The Fox-to-Trump revolving door has been spinning for years. During his first term, Trump hired at least 20 officials who had previously worked at or contributed to Fox, making some of them Cabinet secretaries and high-ranking White House aides. Remember, for instance, Richard Grenell, who joined Fox in 2009 and was still working there when he was nominated to be Trump’s ambassador to Germany in 2017? A few years later, Grenell was named Trump’s acting director of national intelligence. Or Ben Carson, a Fox contributor for years before becoming Trump’s secretary of housing and urban development? One particularly memorable case was Bill Shine, a high-ranking Fox executive, who left the network after allegedly helping to cover up the company’s culture of sexual harassment that brought down his buddy, co-founder Roger Ailes. No problem, though. Shine got a soft landing at the Trump White House as deputy chief of staff for communications, and later moved to Trump’s re-election campaign. It’s hard to jump from Fox to a job at a serious news organization. But, if you want to work at the Trump White House, there are few better resume-builders. “The president’s worldview is shaped by the hours of Fox programming he watches each day, leading him to treat Fox employment as an important credential in hiring,” Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, wrote in 2019. In the past few days, he also tapped Fox News contributor Tom Honan as his “border czar”. Honan joined Fox shortly after his retirement as acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director in 2018, during Trump’s first term. The door spins and spins again. Going for the trifecta, Trump named Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas and former host of a weekly Fox show, as his preferred ambassador to Israel. Can a glorified perch for Sean Hannity – long the Trump whisperer – be far behind? And what about Tucker Carlson, despite being fired by the network last year? The Trump/Fox fit is a natural; one thing they share is a truth problem. Trump, of course, lies with fluid impunity. And Fox – though it insists on calling itself a news organization – has helped to spread lies and disinformation, including about the supposedly “rigged” 2020 election that Trump still insists he won. No matter that Fox had to pay Dominion Voting Systems nearly $800m in a court settlement after they sued for defamation. “Instead of promoting lies and conspiracy theories from outlets like Fox News and the online fever swamps,” wrote Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, “these media personalities will now be doing so with the US government’s resources and backing.” There could be no Trump-as-president without Fox. And Fox’s market capitalization is now approaching $20bn. Whatever they’re doing is working for mutual benefit, if not for US democracy. With this week’s developments, any line of separation – if it ever existed – is being erased. The two are nearly a single organism.

        "The heir to the Colman’s mustard dynasty and his wife, a member of the clergy, have been asked by the Church of England to step back from their roles in a Hampshire church after being named in a damning report on a sadistic abuser. Sir Jamie Colman has been asked to cease his volunteering activities at St Leonard’s church, Oakley, and the Rev Sue Colman has been asked to step back from all ministerial duties by the diocese of Winchester. According to a report, the couple financially supported John Smyth, a powerful and charismatic barrister who sadistically beat boys and young men, despite knowing of the allegations about his abuse. Colman became chair of the Zambesi Trust UK, a charity that channelled funds to Smyth after he moved to southern Africa, and the couple sought to persuade others to support him. They visited Christian camps in Zimbabwe run by Smyth and stayed with the abuser and his wife. A report by Keith Makin on Smyth’s abuse and its cover-up said Colman was “very closely associated with John Smyth” and that his “personal support for John Smyth and his family was very important in enabling John Smyth to develop his mission in Zimbabwe”. Since inheriting the baronetcy from his father last year, Colman has headed a family trust that oversees £9m of investments. A statement from the diocese of Winchester said it had asked Sue Colman “to step back from all ministerial duties while we reflect on the review’s findings and work with the national safeguarding team to take steps to manage any associated risk”. Jamie Colman had “no official ministerial position in our diocese but has also been asked to step back from volunteering”, the statement said. It said Philip Mounstephen, the bishop of Winchester, had “made it clear that all failures in safeguarding should be treated with the utmost seriousness, whether locally or nationally, and that the response to those failures should be proportionate and appropriate.” Meanwhile, a former member of the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC) has said it is “unconscionable” that a retired clergyman who the report said probably knew of Smyth’s abuse but failed to take action could be part of the selection process for the next archbishop of Canterbury. The Rev Andrew Cornes is among a panel of 11 members of the C of E’s ruling body, the General Synod, from whom six will be chosen to sit on the committee that appoints Justin Welby’s successor. Anthony Archer, who sat on the CNC for five years, told the Guardian: “It is unconscionable that Andrew Cornes remained a member of the CNC, but this is a matter for the bishop of Chichester and the archbishops’ secretary for appointments, Stephen Knott. He should of course just resign.” A spokesperson for the diocese of Chichester said they could not comment while the findings of the Makin report were being reviewed by the C of E’s national safeguarding team to see if further action needs to be taken. Comment has been sought from the archbishops’ secretary for appointments. Colman’s mustard is now owned by Unilever.",

        "Dutch authorities have said they are investigating reports of police violence against pro-Palestinian protesters after a banned rally on Wednesday evening had been broken up. Amsterdam police said on X that they were aware of online footage, which seemed to show police officers beating protesters who had already been released after being taken away from the site of the protest. A total of 281 protesters were detained as they rallied in central Amsterdam on Wednesday in defiance of a ban imposed after violence stemming from a football match between Ajax and the Israeli club Maccabi Tel Aviv last week. Detained protesters were put on buses and driven to a location on the outskirts of the city, where they were released. Read more here: Dutch authorities investigate alleged police violence after pro-Palestinian protest Iranian news agency Tasnim reports that Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei has condemned remarks by Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich about Israeli intentions to fully and permanently annex the occupied West Bank. It reports that Baqaei said the comments were a “clear sign of the racist and expansionist nature and the aggressive approach of a regime that was created and expanded based on grabbing Palestinian territories” and “part of the Israeli genocide and its policy of wiping out Palestine, which have been implemented in the most brutal way possible over the past year.” Earlier in the week the finance minister Smotrich had welcomed the election of Donald Trump in the US, complaining that Joe Biden’s administration had “unfortunately chosen to intervene in Israeli democracy”, and that the incoming administration would be an “important opportunity” to “apply Israeli sovereignty to the settlements in Judea and Samaria,” a term used for the West Bank by some Israelis. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, Israel’s military has claimed that in the last 48 hours it has struck what it termed 30 “terror targets” in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahieh. Considered to be a Hezbollah stronghold, the IDF said in its message it had struck at “weapons storage facilities, command centres, and additional terrorist infrastructure sites.” The statement continued: These strikes were a part of the IDF’s ongoing efforts to dismantle and degrade Hezbollah’s military capabilities, and the IDF is continuing to strike Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure sites in the Dahieh area. Reporting from Beirut for the Guardian, on Tuesday William Christou noted that among the places targeted by the strikes were a ten-story block of flats, a chicken restaurant and a medical complex. Lebanese authorities have put the number of people killed by Israeli airstrikes in recent weeks at over 3,000, with more than 14,000 injured. The casualties came on top of those inflicted by exploding pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon in an attack aimed at Hezbollah which Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he personally had ordered. Israel claims to take mitigating precautions to avoid civilian casualties, ordering residents of neighbouring Lebanon out of their homes before it carries out what it claims are “intelligence-based strikes”. Authorities in Lebanon have said about 1.2 million people have been displaced from their homes by fighting in southern Lebanon and the aerial bombardment. Northern Israel has also come under near constant fire from Hezbollah, forcing tens of thousands of people there to evacuate their homes. In the last few minutes warning sirens have again sounded in the western Galilee area of Israel. There are reports of an Israeli attack on Damascus in Syria. More details soon … It is approaching 2pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City, and 3.30pm in Tehran. Here are the headlines … Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the “deliberate and massive forced displacement” of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity Israel’s Arabic-language mnilitary spokesperson has again issued orders for residents to evacuate specific locations in southern Beirut, which has been subject to multiple strikes by Israeli forces on Thursday. Israel claims to be targeting Hezbollah facilities. Several blocks of flats have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in Bint Jbeil in southern Lebanon Hezbollah has claimed to have attacked Israeli troops inside the south-east of Lebanon between Houla and Markaba with a volley of rockets. The claims have not been independently verified Overnight the IDF announced that six Israeli soldiers had been killed inside Lebanon. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict In operational updates posted to its official Telegram channel, the IDF has claimed that in the past week it has killed “over 200” Hezbollah operatives and destroyed 140 rocket launchers in its attacks on southern Lebanon International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi has been in Tehran, and said that Iran’s nuclear installations should “not be attacked”. The UN’s atomic energy chief has said it is important to make progress with Iran in order to avoid the possibility of war Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said the country was not prepared to negotiate about its nuclear programme while it was “under pressure and intimidation”. The head of Iran’s programme, Mohammad Eslami, issued a warning saying “Any interventionist resolution in the nuclear affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran will definitely be met with immediate countermeasures”. The west has accused Iran of enriching uranium for military purposes, which Iran denies The foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority has suggested Israeli ministers have been outlining their ambitions to fully and permanently annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank as a test of international reaction to the policy According to a report Wednesday in the leftwing Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli forces in Gaza are clearing large areas with the apparent intention to remain inside the territory until at least the end of 2025 Overnight the Washington Post has suggested that Israel is working to time any ceasefire deal with Lebanon so that it appears as a “gift” to incoming US president Donald Trump when he takes office. The report says an Isreali official told the paper “There is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump … that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon” Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani arrived in Ankara to meet Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Earlier this week Erdoğan said Turkey had broken off all ties with Israel over its actions in Gaza. Qatar has recently announced it would step back from its attempts to mediate between Israel and Hamas. It said it had concluded the two sides were no longer negotiating in good faith Arwa Damon, who is in the central Gaza Strip for the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance organisation, has told Al Jazeera that the situation in Gaza is “an impossible situation.” Speaking from Deir el-Balah she told the network: The bombing is relentless, there has been no adequate humanitarian assistance, and there isn’t sufficient medical care either. Part of the reluctance to leave the north is fear of the road. People are afraid to be targeted as they are leaving. There are families that are being separated. Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani arrived in Ankara on Thursday, Reuters reports, where he will meet with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Earlier this week the Turkish president stated that his nation had cut off all ties with Israel over its actions in Gaza. Qatar has recently announced it would step back from its attempts to mediate between Israel and Hamas. It said it had concluded the two sides were no longer negotiating in good faith. In a statement today the foreign ministry of the Palestinian Authority has suggested that Israeli ministers have been outlining their ambition to fully and permanently annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank as a test of international reaction. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports the ministry’s spokesperson said: The Israeli government began to issue a torrent of statements and positions regarding its expansionist colonial ambitions and projects calling for the annexation of the occupied West Bank or parts of it, as trial balloons to examine international reactions and the positions of countries in this regard, in an attempt to create a climate conducive to committing this heinous crime. The ministry accused Israel of a “war of extermination, displacement and liquidation of the Palestinian cause … undermining any opportunity to implement the two-state solution.” It accused Israel of “escalating its illegal unilateral measures on the ground, from seizing lands, demolishing homes, [and] paving more colonial roads,” and accused Israel of planning to displace approximately 1,500 citizens by demolishing a neighbourhood in Silwan in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem. International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi has been in Tehran, and as part of his press conference earlier he said that Iran’s nuclear installations should “not be attacked.” The facilities have been oft-mooted targets during the exchanges of fire between Iran and Israel during 2024, and the last attack on Iran by Israel was believed to have targeted air defences which in theory could protect Iran’s nuclear programme. Israel’s recently appointed defense minister, Israel Kataz, this week pointedly said that Iran’s nuclear facilites were “more exposed than ever.” Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the newswires from the region. In the UK, Hamish Falconer, who is the under-secretary of state for the Middle East in the Labour government, has added his voice to condemnation of comments by Israeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich concerning Israeli plans to fully and permanently annexe the West Bank, which it has occupied since 1967. Smotrich, after the election of Donald Trump in the US, declared 2025 to be a “year of sovereignty” for the occupied West Bank, which he habitually calls Judea and Samaria. Falconer said “I condemn minister Smotrich’s comments proposing annexation of land in the West Bank. Annexation only undermines the prospects for peace, would lead to greater instability and would be illegal under international law. The Israeli government must reject this.” Smotrich, who has made similar assertions over the years and has described it as his life’s mission to thwart the creation of a Palestinian state, has faced no sanction from prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the comments. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that in Jalud village, south of Nablus, Israeli settlers have attacked and stolen some of the olive crop. Wafa notes there have been more than 250 attacks of this nature since the beginning of the 2024 olive harvest season. It reports that in today’s incident the settlers fired on Palestinians, and were, it says, “under the protection of the occupation forces.” Al Jazeera reports that two more people have been killed by Israeli strikes on Gaza. The news network reports that “the attack, in Beit Lahiya, which hit a house, also wounded several people.” Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has banned Al Jazeera from operating inside Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In the wake of a new report by Human Rights Watch which accuses Israel of crimes against humanity over its policy of forcing the displacement of people in Gaza, people working for ActionAid Palestine have been talking of their experiences of being forcibly moved around the Gaza Strip by Israel’s military action. Asmaa, 40, works for an organisation helping women and girls in the territory, and says: The war has numerous negative effects on women’s lives. I lost the safety I used to feel. I lost everything imaginable, from my house to my safety, privacy, and dignity. The war took away the house we spent so much time building. Our memories, hopes, and aspirations. These were all stolen from us. Fatma, a project officer with ActionAid, has been displaced multiple times herself, saying: [My family and I] have been trapped in a constant cycle of displacement and loss. We have been forced to flee again and again, moving from the north to the south, seeking and searching for safety, survival and security. The devastation we have endured, seeing the same heartbreak in other families, has been overwhelming. The UN’s atomic energy chief has said it is important to make progress with Iran in order to aovid the possibility of war. Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, was speaking in Tehran at a press conference, after a visit aimed at improving the inspection regime for Iran’s nuclear facilities. AFP quotes him saying: It is indispensable to get, at this point in time, to some concrete, tangible, visible results that will indicate that this joint work is improving the situation … and in a general sense is moving us away from conflict and ultimately war. Earlier, Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said the country was not prepared to negotiate while it was “under pressure and intimidation.” Iran has been accused by the west of using its nuclear programme in an attempt to make weapons. Iran has argued it is a peaceful civilian energy programme. The head of Iran’s programme, Mohammad Eslami, speaking alongside Grossi, also issued a warning, saying: Any interventionist resolution in the nuclear affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran will definitely be met with immediate countermeasures. Israel’s Arabic-language mnilitary spokesperson has again issued orders for residents to evacuate specific locations in southern Beirut ahead of an imminent Israeli attack. Israel claims to be targeting Hezbollah facilities. The city has already been struck several times today. Lebanon’s National News Agency reports that Israel has struck twice at Deir el Zahrani in the south of the country, after munitions failed to explode in the initial attack. The NNA published a picture of an Israeli weapon lying unexploded in the road. Palestinian media sources are reporting that Hezbollah has claimed to have attacked Israeli troops inside the south-east of Lebanon between Houla and Markaba with a volley of rockets. The claims have not been independently verified. Several blocks of flats have been destroyed by Israeli strikes in Bint Jbeil in southern Lebanon, AFP reports, citing Lebanese media. The town is close to the UN-drawn blue line that separates Israel and Lebanon. Israel says it has been targeting Hezbollah facilities in the area. Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, has posted a readout to social media after meeting with the head of the UN’s nuclear agency, the IAEA. In the messages, Araqchi said he and Rafael Grossi had “important and straightforward talks” but stressed that Tehran was not willing to entertain negotiations “under pressure and intimidation.” He continued: As a committed member of NPT [the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons] we continue our full cooperation with the IAEA. Differences can be resolved through cooperation and dialogue. We agreed to proceed with courage and good will. Iran has never left the negotiation table on its peaceful nuclear programme. The ball is in the EU/E3 court. Willing to negotiate based on our national interest and our inalienable rights, but NOT ready to negotiate under pressure and intimidation. The last part could be read as a warning to incoming US president Donald Trump, who unilaterally pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions. Iran has always maintained its nuclear programme is an entirely peaceful civilian one, an assertion that has been doubted by some western observers, in particular the US and Israel, who have accused Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons. Israel has never officially declared it has a nuclear weapons capability, but is widely believed to do so. Israel’s military has reported warning sirens sounding again in northern Israel. Overnight the IDF announced that six soldiers had been killed in clashes with Hezbollah inside southern Lebanon. The Times of Israel reports “it was one of the heaviest single-day losses in the operation that began in late September,” and that “according to an initial IDF probe, the soldiers were killed in an exchange of fire with at least four Hezbollah operatives inside a building in a village in southern Lebanon.” Lebanese authorities have put the death toll in the country since Israel stepped up its airstrikes at over 3,000 people, with more than 14,000 people wounded. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. According to a report yesterday in the leftwing Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Israeli forces in Gaza are clearing large areas with the apparent intention to remain inside the territory until at least the end of 2025. The newspaper reported that a “combat graph for 2025” distributed in recent weeks to Israeli soldiers and commanders in Gaza describes “exposing large areas” in the coastal strip: destroying existing buildings and infrastructure in addition to the construction of roads and preparations for building more permanent military facilities. Overnight the Washington Post has suggested that Israel is working to time any ceasefire deal with Lebanon so that it appears as a “gift” to incoming US president Donald Trump when he takes office. The report says an Isreali official told the paper “There is an understanding that Israel would gift something to Trump … that in January there will be an understanding about Lebanon.” There have been contradictory noises from Israeli ministers about the prospects for a settlement on Israel’s northern front in recent days. Foreign minister Gideon Saar said “certain progress” had been made on a deal, but defense minister Israel Katz said there would be “no ceasefire” and “no respite” in Lebanon, and that Israel “will not take our foot off the pedal” in its fight against Hezbollah. At least one member of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has said they will collapse the coalition if a peace deal was signed with Hezbollah. Hezbollah has said it has had no direct participation in talks. Reuters has a quick snap, citing local medics, that three people have been killed by an Israeli strike on Gaza City, with ten others wounded. More details soon … Lebanon’s National News Agency reports an Israeli strike on Nabatieh in the south of the country. Here are some of the latest pictures sent over the newswires from Beirut in Lebanon, which has again been the target of Israeli strikes. Israel’s military has issued a further set of orders for people in the southern suburbs of Beirut to evacuate. Lebanese media reports there have been at least three strikes on the Choueifat area, which is a suburb in the south-east of Lebanon’s capital, close to the international airport. More details soon … In operational updates posted to its official Telegram channel, Israel has claimed that in the past week it has killed “over 200” Hezbollah operatives and destroyed 140 rocket launchers in its attacks on southern Lebanon. Authorities in Lebanon have put the death toll from recent Israeli strikes at over 3,000, with more than 14,000 people injured. It has not been possible for journalists to independently verify the casualty figures being issued during the conflict. It its statement, the IDF said of its attacks on Lebanon “These strikes further degrade Hezbollah’s capability to carry out terror attacks from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilians on the northern border. The IDF will continue to operate to thwart any danger or threat against the State of Israel.” Tens of thousands of Israelis have been forced to flee their homes in the north of the country, and Benjamin Netanyahu has set their safe return as one of Israel’s war aims. Israel’s military also states that it continues to operate in the Beit Lahia and Jabaliya areas of the Gaza Strip where, it says, “troops located a large amount of weapons and eliminated dozens of terrorists from the air and ground.” The claims have not been independently verified. Israel is using evacuation orders to pursue the “deliberate and massive forced displacement” of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which says the policy amounts to crimes against humanity. The US-based group added it had collected evidence that suggested “the war crime of forcible transfer [of the civilian population]”, describing it as “a grave breach of the Geneva conventions and a crime under the Rome statute of the international criminal court”. The report was published amid mounting evidence that Israel is accelerating its efforts to cut the Gaza Strip in two with a buffer zone and is building new infrastructure to support a prolonged military presence, with an increased pace of demolitions and destruction. Residents in northern Gaza said Israeli forces were besieging displaced families and the remaining population, which some estimated at a few thousand, ordering them to head south through a checkpoint separating two towns and a refugee camp from Gaza City. Men were held for questioning, while women and children were allowed to continue towards Gaza City, residents and Palestinian medics said. Calling for Israel’s policy of forced displacement to be investigated by the international criminal court, Human Rights Watch also urged targeted sanctions against Israel including the cessation of arms sales.

Here are the headlines … Israel’s military has claimed that in the last week it has killed “over 200” Hezbollah members and dismantled 140 rocket launchers in southern Lebanon. The claims have not been independently verified Human Rights Watch said in a report released Thursday that Israel’s repeated evacuation orders in Gaza amount to the “war crime of forcible transfer”, and to “ethnic cleansing” in parts of the Palestinian territory International Atomic Energy Agency director general Rafael Grossi met Iran’s top diplomat Thursday during a visit to Tehran. Later, Grossi is expected to meet president Masoud Pezeshkian in their first meeting since his election earlier this year, and to hold a press conference Australia has backed a UN resolution to recognise the “permanent sovereignty” of Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, marking a major departure from its previous position Ice-cream brand Ben &amp; Jerry’s said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that parent company Unilever has silenced its attempts to express support for Palestinian refugees",

        "It was a funny game, Australia’s 0-0 World Cup qualifying draw with Saudi Arabia on Thursday evening; a contest in which neither side could be said to have played at their best but, at the same time, both will have left kicking themselves that they didn’t take the three points. For the Socceroos, it was a tale, yet again, of telling moments going begging. And for the Green Falcons, inches, if that, that denied them a dramatic 95th-minute winner. With just seconds remaining, having not created all that much going forward across the second half, the ball sat up for Sultan Al-Ghannam on the second phase of a free kick. The 27,491 fans in the stadium held their breath and the Al-Nassr wingback seized the moment, driving a low effort beyond Joe Gacui and into the bottom corner of the net. It was a dagger, a late strike that had won the game. Pandemonium broke out on the Saudi bench and the strong contingent of their fans in the stands. But gradually the celebrations become more muted. The realisation sank in first amongst the players on the pitch and those watching on from the terraces. Amidst all the raucousness, the assistant’s flag had been raised. The ball had gone through Ali Al-Bulaihi’s legs as it made its way into the net and the defender, by the barest of margins, had been behind the last figure in Green and Gold when the shot was launched. By definition, that meant he was interfering with play from an offside position. The goal would not stand, a winning start to the second Hervé Renard era in charge denied. “I just saw the reaction,” Renard said of the moment. “We have to give confidence to the ref. But I have to see once again to be sure they made the best decision. So no more comments about it.” For the Socceroos, though, maybe there was a sense of balance to that turn of fate, given that on another night they easily could have been ahead. Three times across the opening 45 minutes and once more in the dying stages, the side in green and gold were presented with gilt-edged opportunities to open the scoring and four times that moment had slipped through their grasp. In the 18th minute, Lewis Miller’s header from an Ajdin Hrustic free kick was blocked by Feras Al-Brikan into the path of Harry Souttar in the six-yard box, only for the towering defender to sky his effort over the bar. In the 45th, the press from Aiden O’Neill saw Nasser Al-Dawsari cough the ball up for Mitch Duke, who would square the ball to Hrustic in space at the top of the box, only for his tame effort to be easily handled by Saudi keeper Ahmed Al-Kassar. Five minutes later, with effectively the last action of the half, another pressing manoeuver saw Jackson Irvine steal a pass from Faisel Al-Ghamdi, play a one-two with Duke and advance towards goal before placing an off-balance shot wide, the ball he’d been hoping to play to Hrustic never eventuating. In the 84th minute, Miller slid the ball in behind the Saudi lines for substitute Brandon Borrello to advance clear in on goal but, at the final moment, the attacker opted to attempt to square the ball for McGree for an ostensible tap-in rather than shoot himself, giving the visitor’s defence the scope to heroically scramble the ball clear. For a side that has struggled to create chances consistently, it was a quartet of moments that needed to be seized. They didn’t play well in the opening half but still had three chances. They played better in the second and only had one. Yet none were taken and a chance to take a giant step towards 2026 went begging. “They brought a lot of energy in the first half and I don’t think we coped with that very well,” said Australia coach Tony Popovic. “We weren’t very good with the ball and we looked a little bit heavy and lethargic. “But in the second half, I thought we really improved and took control of the game, which was pleasing.” Ultimately, both sides exit with a point, largely in the same place they found themselves coming in and likely to be leapfrogged in the group by Bahrain, who host bottom-placed China later on Thursday; McGree’s last-minute bicycle kick that bounced just wide another tease of what glories may have been.",
